This project is a web-based Domestic Animal Disease Prediction application that uses deep learning to classify the health status of cows, dogs, and goats. The system trains a single model on multiple datasets, including cow diseases (FMD, Lumpy Skin, Mastitis, Healthy), dog diseases (Demodicosis, Dermatitis, Fungal Infection, Hypersensitivity, Ringworm, Healthy), and goat health status (Healthy, Unhealthy). Users can upload images of animals through a Flask web interface, where the application preprocesses the images and predicts the disease using a trained CNN model. The results, along with the uploaded image, are displayed on a user-friendly web page. This tool can assist farmers and veterinarians in quickly identifying common animal diseases, supporting timely intervention and better animal health management.
